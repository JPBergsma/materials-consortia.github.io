# OPTiMaDe API Specification

**The latest _stable_ version** is found in the [master](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/OPTiMaDe/tree/master) branch in the GitHub repository.  
**The latest _in development_ version** is found in the [develop](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/OPTiMaDe/tree/develop) branch of the same repository.  
As a rule-of-thumb, the _in development_ version number is the next patched version, when compared with the _stable_ version (always having a `-develop` suffix) as well.

If you are a **server** developer, it is _recommended_ to always implement the latest stable version. It is also _recommended_ to implement the latest version in development.
You may want to use the same _master_ and _develop_ branch model employed here.

If you are a **client** developer, you are _encouraged_ to support at least the latest stable version, while it is _recommended_ to support the latest version in development.
You may want to use the same _master_ and _develop_ branch model employed here.
